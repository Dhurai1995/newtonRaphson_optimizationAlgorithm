# Stochastic optimization algorithm HP1
## Newton raphson algorithm
This is an introductory home problem to the Stochastic optimization algorithm course

A program that takes as input (the coefficients of) an nth degree polynomial and a
starting point, and which then uses Newton-Raphsonâ€™s method to find the nearest stationary point of the polynomial.
